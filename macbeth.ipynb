        "The Scottish Play has received a lot of attention recently as the prime example of a work of literature that is \"creepy\", \"ominous\", \"foreboding\".  The key word is \"the\" used with MacBeth talking about his eyes, arms, hands, hinting at dissociation from himself.  We're going to do something a little different.  We're going to show how we can use a small amount of data to identify passages that refer to three things:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Battles\n",
        "* Weapons\n",
        "* People getting hurt or injured\n",
        "\n",
        "While MacBeth refers to these topics quite genrously, we can't really assume that the majority of the play's text will mention this.  The conventional approach will be to synthesize training data using a T5 paraphraser, and then run a classifier on the synthesized data.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we are going to try something a bit different.  We're going to train an RNN, which is extremely data-hungry, on a minimal amount of labelled data.  However, the labelled data will be extremely rich.  RNN's data-hungriness derives from the fact that they are usually trained on one-hot vectors referring to characters or even words.  This forces them to learn the multiple dependencies between letters and words before they can producing meaningful content or classify sequences meaningfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, what happens if we use extremely rich representations of the data, that encode all the dependencies that RNN's have to learn from scratch?  Will this allow them to evade their characteristic data-hungriness?   That is the question we will explore in this notebook.  We are going to take the ROBERTA vectorization of every verse of MacBeth, model character's lines as a sequence, and attempt to build an RNN classifier for the \"gloomy\" content mentioned above.  Our hypothesis is that this will allow to build a rather sophisticated classifier with a miminum of labelled data, because the RNN is learning only the encodings of this content across vectorizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "I hope this will allow people to deal with TP-sparse data sets characteristic of environments such as compliance, fraud-detection, legal literature, where the relevant content tends to manifest itself in very indirect ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Parse the text from MacBeth\n",
        "* Label the text\n",
        "* Vectorize the text\n",
        "* Train an RNN classifier on the labeled text\n",
        "* Classify the text\n",
        "* Rank passages according to their relevance"

        "The underlying assumption with an RNN is that it attempts to detect cyclicality in the observations.  `V` implies a natural momentum to the state vectors, which is modified by `W` and `v`.  One could think of this as a journey from the northernmost point of a sphere, southward, and then back up north.  The observables affect the latitude of `h`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Because of this, they are capable of capturing short-term and long-term dependencies in sequences such as letters or words.  However, in order for these to be learned properly, the data has to contain all of the combinatorics in proper proportion.  As such, while they are quite effective at classification, vectorization, and natural language generation, these models can be quite data-hungry.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformer models are now the state-of-the-art in sequence generation and classification.  They have broken through most NLP benchmarks quite effectively.  Particularly in sentence vectorization, they are very sensitive to both lexical and syntactic content.  However, in production they can introduce certain bottlenecks, as they are large and computationally expensive.  This has significant budgetary implications.\n",
        "\n",
        "One thing I have noticed in practice is that transformer vectorizations can also be used quite effectively as input to simpler models.  For example, I have seen logits run on BERT vectorizations for classification purposes.  This is not \"transfer learning\" in the strictest sense, as transfer learning involves fine-tuning the coefficients of the original transformer to complete a designated task.  However, it could be seen as something along the lines of transfer learning, since all the syntactic, semantic, and lexical information is already encoded in the vector, and a simpler model can learn these features.\n",
        "\n",
        "If an RNN can work on richer vectorizations than the typical one-hot or word2vec data, it is possible that it can learn higher-level abstractions in the text, such as discourse, allusion, metaphor.  If it can do this with not-very-common language (such as Shakespeare) then it can do it with other sparse, poorly annotated datasets such as email, chat, or legal-bureaucratic language."

        "In this project, we take poetic passages from MacBeth.  One passage from one speaker is a \"line\", and each verse in the passage is an observable in the sequence.  We will be using Facebook's Distilled Roberta model to vectorize the verses, and we will be applying layer normalization to these vectors to smooth them and make them easier to process by the RNN.  If the line contains at least one reference to weapons, injury, or violence, then the line is marked as a positive example.  We only mark a small subset of lines, and rank them according to relevance.  For log-softmax probabilities of positive and negative classification, `p_p` and `p_n`, we define relevance as `p_p - p_n`.  Because these are logarithms, this can be seen as a quotient of the orignal probabilities. "
