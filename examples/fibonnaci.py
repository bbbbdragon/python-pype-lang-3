This shows you how to run the Fibonnaci sequence using three different, but 
syntactically equivalent pype expressions.  Let's take a walk through the main
statement:

    (fib0,_-1)+(fib0,_-2),

The placeholder _ is the variable from the last evaluated fArg, in this case x.  
We are computing the Fibonnaci sequence for x-1 in (fib0,_-1), and for x-2 in 
(fib0,_-2), and adding them together.

However, we only want to do this when x > 1.  If x is 1 or 0, we return x. 

So we are going to show how we can do this, getting simpler and simpler.

def fib0(x):
    '''
    Here, we have a switch dict:

              {_ > 1:(fib0,_-1)+(fib0,_-2),
               'else':_})

    This just means, if x > 1, then return the sum of the function called on x-1 and x-2.
    Otherwise, just return x, which will be 1 or 0.  
    '''
    return p( x,
              {_ > 1:(fib0,_-1)+(fib0,_-2),
               'else':_})


def fib1(x):
    '''
    Here, however, we use the iff macro.  So for a conditional fArg cond, and a 
    statement, iff(cond,statement) evaluates as:

              {cond:statement,
               'else':_}

    So, we only apply the sum to x if it's above 1.
    '''
    return p( x,
              iff(_ > 1,(fib1,_-1)+(fib1,_-2)))


def fib2(x):
    '''
    Now, we are stripping out the return statement, since the compiler includes it.
    '''
    p( x,
       iff(_ > 1,(fib2,_-1)+(fib2,_-2)))


def fib3(x):
    '''
    And now, we are even stripping out the pype call, which the compiler can handle.
    '''
    (x,
     iff(_ > 1,(fib3,_-1)+(fib3,_-2)))


def fib4(x):
    '''
    And last but not least, we are enclosing this in a singleton tuple with no 
    reference to x (note the , at the end).  We can do this because the compiler
    infers that _ can only refer to x, since there are no other variables in the
    scope of the function.

    iff(_ > 1,(fib4,_-1)+(fib4,_-2)),
